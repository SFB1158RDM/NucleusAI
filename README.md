# NucleusAI
The goal of the proposed project is to implement a deep-learning application programming interface (API) for image data processing and to provide a platform for the scientific community to directly compare and integrate data generated across our consortium projects. The development of an open-source and extensible platform to train and share deep-learning models will guarantee high standards in many image analysis workflows and additionally reduce the amount of annotated data necessary for training supervised deep-learning algorithms. The initial efforts would involve further development of StarDist ( https://github.com/stardist/stardist ). Based on the existing StarDist GUI framework, we will further integrate other commonly used deep-learning image analysis tools to make the initial GUI more flexible for model training and inferences. Some of the considered tools include CARE (image enhancement) (Weigert et al. 2018), Noise2Void (image denoising) (Krull et al. 2018), CellPose (cell segmentation) (Stringer et al. 2021) and Elektronn3 (EM data segmentation, https://github.com/ELEKTRONN/elektronn3).
